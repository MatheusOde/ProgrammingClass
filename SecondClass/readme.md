# Hello again!

This is our second class. Create a _"class2.c"_ in your repository

## Firstly

Give class1 a read and remember what we've done. Also make sure to look into class1.c again

## The objective:

In this class we will expand our understanding of functions and make a basic program in C using some different variables. We want a program that says "What's the product?", gets the id of the product, sends it to a function which returns a price and a name, says the price and name, ask for quantity and says the total price.

So basically like this:
"What's the product?"
4473289
"The product 4473289 costs _20_ dollars and is _a headphone_."
"How much do you intend to buy?"
1
"Okay, the cost is _20_ dollars"

## The variables:

## Look at class2.c and then try your version
