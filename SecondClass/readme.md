# Hello again!

This is our second class, Read everything before doing anything. Create a _"class2.c"_ in your repository

## Firstly

Give class1 a read and remember what we've done. Also make sure to look into class1.c again

## The objective:

In this class we will expand our understanding of functions and make a basic program in C using some different variables. We want a program that says "What's the product?", gets the id of the product, sends it to two functions which returns a price and a name, says the price and name, ask for quantity and says the total price.

So basically like this:

"What's the product?"

4473289

"The product 4473289 costs _20_ dollars and is _a headphone_."

"How much do you intend to buy?"

1

"Okay, the cost is _20_ dollars"

## The variables:

We'll be using a lot of variables.

The first one is a _"int"_ an integer (n√∫mero inteiro) which goes up to 2147483647. This will be our id

The second one is a _"float"_ a rational number which has decimals like in 20.01

The third one is _"char[]"_. char is a caracter like "b". A char[] is a bunch of caracteres limited by the number indicated by the char. If a char is char[5] then the max number of letters is 5. There is also _"char * "_, which is a pointer, a concept a lot harder that we'll see later but will use in this example.

## Look at class2.c and then try your version
